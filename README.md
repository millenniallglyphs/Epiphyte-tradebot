# Epiphyte
Epiphyte is a prototype for a new kind of economy, that uses living sensors to account for the externalities of industry. Employing lichen and moss to develop air quality metrics, epiphyte makes trades on the stock market that correspond to environmental health.

This is a work in progress trade bot that analyzes lichen specimens using a web cam, making trades based on changes in specimen health.

# Hardware
This tradebot was created to run on a Raspberry Pi conntected to a Arducam 5 Megapixels 1080p OV5647 Camera Module.

# Dependencies  
[Open CV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) and [Intrino Python API](https://github.com/intrinio/intrinio-realtime-python-sdk) are required. <br>
Note: I am running this on my Pi using [VirtualWrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

# Getting it to Work
